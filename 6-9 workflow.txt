- Don't read out full order more than once (this was an issue for umai, need to test for curr)
- dont query customer name if not necessary, make separate field for pick up name
- NEVER let the agent say its human ~~done~~
- inaccurate dish description (agent making shi tup) ~~done~~
- add line "you will/please pay at the store/restaurant" ~~done~~
- if agent doesnt know the answer to a question, ask customer if they would like to transfer to a representative ~~done~~
- dont ask for special requests after order is changed after total is calculated (kind of rare edge case i guess) ~~done~~
-

adjustments for template:
instead of using manually scripting to parse menu, do it through ai api
embeddings

n8n
dspy
