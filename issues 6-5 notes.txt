possible issues with current convo flow agent:

not being able to complete orders
not being able to calculate totals because of modifiers
example: ordering fried rice and agent not asking for what type
gluten-free modifiers
umai sushi gluten free lady example: agent says greetings, lady asks for information about gluten-free options, agent pushes her towards answering questions regarding name/phone number (this is likely due to conversation flow being at a state where they require answer to get to next state, a possible fix could be an intemediatary state where the agent answers any possible questions rather than going straight to completing an order)
in this example order, gluten-free modifiers were not added to the order notes, nor was it added to each individual item (though this may be the fault of the pos system used and not the agent), one possible fix could be using a general output for additional order notes that may not be in the modifiers
another example with umai:
lady orders a bunch of stuff, agent seems to handle fine, she asks for total, agent doesn't answer her, rather reading her order (probably because thats a state in convo flow), agent reads wrong total first (53 dollars), then calculates total as 51.42, reads that number back, lady disagrees, she asks for a person, agent transfers her to rep
the problem here is that the ai gives a total and then a different total, we can give estimated total first

pros/what we need to ensure:
handles and is patient with long orders from people who are unsure/have dietary restrictions, so they may take longer

which of these issues would switching to a single prompt based agent resolve?:

what possible/example new issues does it bring up?:
less deterministic/direction flow due to high flexibility, could lead to orders not being completed or certain information being left out because the agent doesnt have any skeleton/frame
problems can be hard to identify and recreate because behavior is likely a lot more random and hard to predict



solution to total stuff:
if customer asks for total and agent is in a state previous to total calculation node, just answer by saying "your estimated total, which does not include tax and other fees, is:" when providing this number, ensure you are using step by step mathematical reasoning to have an accurate approximation.
agent responds back with terminology that user uses, but it should be reading the exact name of the item on the menu in order to avoid issues like this
(also test for if this issue occurs with something like "six piece salmon", will it get confused with whether its a roll, sashimi, nigiri?)

suggestion for more consistent pronounciations of colloquial speech patterns for numbers:
add commas, use phonetic/actual word spelling instead of numerical symbols, 

testing delivery functions:
distance checking (4 miles)
total minimum for delivery (25)





another problem:
can't say no to placing the order (could be a non issue, but andy got same issue) call_bcc5d416e60afd5190694892b02 HONG KONG PALACE
    node for how can i help you further
    or, copy method used in order summary when someone wants to change a dish/add a dish
where is it getting salmon sashimi for 6.5 dollars??

potential issue of adding condiments/modifiers twice?
double charging for sashimi   (6 pieces confused with 6 orders of 2 pieces)

move towards using hong kong palace as it isnt live and we should stop using prod envs for testing lmfao

andy nagoya sushi test:
16:40 6/5
it didn't ask for what kind of soda 



additional notes: likely need to be more forgiving in what it allows the user to say, for example, allow user to interrupt and if the stt isnt clear, have agent respond "hey, i didn't quite get that, can you repeat what you said?"
so up the interrupt sensitivity
